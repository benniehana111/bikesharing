## Citibike Case Study

# Overview

This analysis examines data on the Citibike bikesharing service in New York City in order to derive insights for the creation of a similiar bikesharing service in Des Moines, Iowa. To inform potential investment decisions in a Des Moines bikesharing service, this study examines usage patterns in the NYC Citibike service.

# Results

Men account for approximately 75% of the customer base.

The peak ridership hours are during weekday morning (8-9am) and evening (5-7pm) rush hours, with significant usage on the weekends between 10am and 6pm.

There is little significant difference between the peak usage hours of women and men.

The peak ridership ocurred on Thursdays; the lowest ridership occurred on Wednesdays.
